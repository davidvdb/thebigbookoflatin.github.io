So. You decided you want to learn Latin (Or was forced by the Board of Education). You decided the official language of the Romans and the basis of languages like English was for you. You decided that you must know every verb, noun, case, tense, voice, etc. will make you a better person. (Or you know, there a test next week on verbs and sentences.) Then you, my friend, will bookmark this page, sit back, and read.

Let's begin.


Some people consider Latin a dead language that is obsolete to learn. Consider them wrong. Like I said before, Latin is the foundation of many modern languages. Consider it like a strong foundation. If you can master Latin, you can go on and learn a bunch of different languages or at least, won't get lost reading it when Google Translating every word. From now on, I'll be teaching you various parts of Latin that will give you a strong foundation for the language. Stay tuned!

P.S. IF you're taking the SAT, Latin would be especially helpful for you! Learning a bunch of Latin roots can help you with the vocabulary section and it's a lot quicker than studying a bunch of hard words.
