##Before you begin

Before you can start, you must get a Latin dictionary. (Duh.) There is many options for this. The cheapest would be the online dictionaries. My recommendation is [The Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html). It's frequently updated and a great resource.

##Latin Dictionary Entries for Nouns
All dictionary entries for nouns will always begin with the nominative singular form and the genitive singular form. In some cases, the stem of both forms will be the same, so some dictionaries will only provide the ending. (The stem of a noun is the form without any ending attached to it.)

>For example, love – ama, puellae could also be listed as girl – puella, -ae because the stem, puell-, is the same for both.

It is important for you to memorize both the nominative and genitive singular when learning a noun because both are needed for declension.

Dictionary entries for nouns will also contain the gender of the noun. The gender is essential to know when declining a noun and when using it (or reading it) in a sentence. The three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter are commonly abbreviated m, f, and n.

(Declining means to list all possible case forms for that noun.)

Some nouns will have more information associated with them, such as those that have genitive plurals that end in -ium where a -um ending would be expected, and those that have additional irregular forms. (More on that later.)

##Latin Dictionry Entries for Adjectives
There are three types of adjectives: those whose nominative forms are different in each of the masculine, feminine and neuter (3 termination), those whose nominative forms are the same in the masculine and feminine, but different in the neuter (2 termination), and those whose nominative forms are the same for all three genders (1 termination).

The majority of adjectives fall into the first category, and their dictionary entries will give the nominative singular form for the masculine, feminine and neuter, in that order. 

For example, big – magnus, magna, magnum. 

Whenever an adjective has three forms in its dictionary entry, it is a 3-termination adjective. As with nouns, when the stem is the same for all three words, just the endings may be given.

(big – magnus, -a, -um.)

In part two, I'll explain the other types.

Remember, since adjectives can modify nouns of any gender, a specific gender will never be given in the dictionary definition of an adjective.

##Latin Dictionary Entries for Verbs
In Latin, verbs have four principal parts, that is, four parts that are used to conjugate a verb. They are normally listed in the verb’s dictionary entry. 

The English translation of the principal parts of the verb “praise”: laudo, laudare, laudavi, laudatus are “I praise, to praise, I praised, (having been) praised.” The first two principal parts are used to form the tenses in the present system and are found in books of all levels. The second two principal parts are used to form the tenses in the perfect system. However, I strongly recommended that you memorize all principal parts of a verb when you first learn it, so you won’t have to spend time re-memorizing later on.

Just as in nouns or adjectives, identical stems of verbs are sometimes left out of dictionary entries to save space. For example, laudo may be written as follows: laudo, -are, -avi, -atus.

Other information, such as what case or construction can be expected following a verb, may also be found in a dictionary entry.

##Latin Dictionary Entries for Prepositions and Adverbs
These words don’t usually have more than one form, so their part of speech is indicated by an italicized prep. or adv. Prepositions are always followed by nouns, so their dictionary definition will indicate what case they take, and this information should be memorized when learned.

This is alot of information, but it's vital for learning Latin. You might like to readf this more than once.
