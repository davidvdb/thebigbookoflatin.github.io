## About us:

I am a regular high school student stuck learning a language that's suppose to be dead. It took me hours of studying, lots of painful tests and alot of coffee to learn this language. I wondered why wasn't there a website to help people with Latin. So, as my New Year's Resolution, I decided to make a blogy-style website to teach people one of the most important dead languages around. It's not going to be easy. Trust me, I know. I also enjoy making fun of Latin, and will do it often.
